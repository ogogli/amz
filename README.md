DatavizAMZ is an open-source, high-performance WebGIS application designed to automate the retrieval, processing, and interactive visualization of meteorological data. Developed by the **Study and Research Group in Big Data (WDS) at the University of São Paulo (USP)**, the platform serves as a flexible architecture tailored for environmental monitoring, specifically optimized to track weather dynamics across the Amazon basin and South America.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Programmatic integration with NOAA's Global Forecast System (GFS) via the `herbie` ecosystem.
* **Advanced Data Ingestion & Smoothing:** Applies a Gaussian filter to mitigate high-frequency noise and employs bicubic interpolation to upscale raw matrices, preventing blocky artifacts.
* **Vector Field Visualizations:** Encodes North-South ($u$) and East-West ($v$) wind velocity components directly into the red and blue color channels of PNG files, enabling real-time particle advection via GPU on the client side.
* **Unified & Lightweight Architecture:** Both frontend components (HTML/JS/MapLibre) and backend scripts (Python 3) can be co-located on a single standard web server (Apache/Nginx).

## 🛠️ System Architecture

The software operates under a decoupled, automated data pipeline synchronized with NOAA's synoptic update cycles (accounting for the standard 3.5 to 4-hour publication latency):

[ NOAA Servers / AWS S3 ]
│ (Automated Cron Job / Herbie API Retrieval)
▼
[ Backend: Python 3 Processing ] ──► Gaussian Filter & Bicubic Interpolation
│
▼
[ Matrix Exportation ] ──► Generates PNG files (Scalar Layers & RGB-encoded Wind Vectors)
│
▼
[ Frontend: MapLibre Dashboard ] ──► Real-time rendering & Fluid particle advection

## 📋 Software Requirements

### Backend (Python 3.8+)
The pipeline relies on the following standard utility modules and scientific libraries:
* `herbie` (Data discovery and retrieval)
* `numpy` & `xarray` (Multidimensional matrix manipulation)
* `matplotlib` & `imageio` (Image processing and PNG exportation)
* `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `warnings` (System and scheduling utilities)

### Web Hosting & Frontend
* An HTTP Web Server (**Apache**, **Nginx**, or equivalent).
* **MapLibre GL JS** framework (loaded client-side for interactive map rendering).

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/DatavizAMZ.git](https://github.com/your-username/DatavizAMZ.git)
cd DatavizAMZ
2. Configure the Backend Environment
We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Make sure your requirements.txt includes: herbie, numpy, xarray, matplotlib, imageio)
3. Deploy the Dashboard
Move the contents of the frontend/ directory to your web server's root directory (e.g., /var/www/html/datavizamz).
4. Automate Data Retrieval
To bypass NOAA's data processing latency, configure a daily cron job on your Linux environment to trigger the script strictly after the submission completion windows. Open your crontab configuration:
Bash
crontab -e
Add the following line to run the automated script daily (example configured for 05:30 UTC to download the complete 00z forecast horizon):
Bash
30 5 * * * /path/to/DatavizAMZ/venv/bin/python /path/to/DatavizAMZ/backend/download_pipeline.py
